## Using Python to create an Integrated Modular Framework for Atomistic Modeling of Molecular Structures
Presented at SciPy 2016.  The design was adapted from the poster designed by Felix Breuer (http://blog.felixbreuer.net/2010/10/24/poster.html).

## Abstract
Structure models provide information essential to understanding the biological function of molecules.
Numerous computational applications, requiring various levels of expertise, have been developed for modeling biomolecular structures.
This has led to a disjointed array of modeling tools and techniques, many unapproachable without specific training, and none of which cover the entire workflow of modeling structures that reproduce experimental data.
We have leveraged the flexibility of Python to create an open-source application that effectively combines different computational tools and techniques to unify the entire workflow of solving fundamental structural biology and biotechnological problems.
The Python environment is suited to this project as it presents a low barrier to entry while enabling developers to integrate existing and new applications, while also leveraging the increased performance of lower level programming languages and scaling from personal to high-performance computing resources.
Using the resulting integrated modular framework, researchers with expertise in state-of-the-art experimental techniques have been able to model a variety of biological systems using advanced tools without investing resources into significant computational training.

## Long Description
### Background
Molecular structure models provide information essential to understanding the biological function of molecules.
Numerous experimental and computational methods are available for respectively measuring and modeling bimolecular structures, most of which require significant training and experience to apply effectively.
Consequently, many researchers lack the experience required to employ advanced modeling techniques and instead resort to simplistic models.
In some cases, a research group will invest resources to develop more advanced modeling tools, tailored to their specific need, but such efforts often duplicate the work of others or even become obsolete as the developers leave the group.

The Collaborative Computational Projects (CCPs), http://www.ccp.ac.uk/, provide a unified software infrastructure to build, maintain, and distribute code libraries for various research areas.
The small-angle scattering (SAS) CCP, CCP-SAS (http://ccpsas.org), aims to provide atomistic modeling software for modeling SAS experiments.
The project is funded through a joint EPSRC (EP/K039121/1) and NSF (CHE-1265821) grant with contributors from US and UK universities and X-ray and neutron scattering facilities, including the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).

At the NCNR, we support users with diverse expertise who come to use the state-of-the-art neutron scattering facilities to probe the structure of biomolecules.

want to use physics based simulations tools for quickly modeling their experimental systems.

We have leveraged the flexibility of Python to create an open-source application that effectively combines different computational tools and techniques to solve fundamental structural biology and biotechnological problems.

### Methods
The Python environment presents a low barrier to entry while enabling developers to integrate existing and new applications, while also leveraging the increased performance of lower level programming languages and scaling from personal to high-performance computing resources.

### Results
Using the resulting integrated modular framework, researchers with expertise in state-of-the-art experimental techniques have been able to model a variety of biological systems using advanced tools without investing resources into significant computational training.
